Story time:
**Original idea from my cousin who does exercise - not like me. but maybe soon I'll start again on my journey. I hope.**

It just counts your predefined workout repetitions...very basic idea...

And now > 190 people are using it based on my analytics in the google play dev console, which is nice...had some bad reviews becuase I maintain it very occasionally...


Tech stack:
- Android SDK
- Kotlin
- Room - for remembering the stuff
- and other cool libraries
